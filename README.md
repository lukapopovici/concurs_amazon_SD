# Amazon "Learn and be curious" 

Repository for the code written for the Amazon "Learn and be curious" contest held at my [UNI](https://ac.tuiasi.ro/) for the Data Structures and Algorithms course. 

## The first problem (90/100 points)
### Code can be found [here](https://github.com/lukapopovici/concurs_amazon_SD/tree/main/problema1/AMAZON).
This problem required the representation of a deck of cards as a doubly linked list inside a doubly linked list and implementation of multiple operations to be performed on said decks (ex:Shuffle,Split Deck, Merge,etc).<br>

## The second problem (100/100 points)
### Code can be found [here](https://github.com/lukapopovici/concurs_amazon_SD/tree/main/problema2).
A library database that keeps track of dictionary-like books, users, return dates, and book/userscores (all powered by hashtables).
